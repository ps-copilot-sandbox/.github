# Contributing to Our Project

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting an idea or bug
- Discussing the current state of a repository
- Submitting a fix
- Asking the hard questions and being opinionated

And again, thank you! We are excited to work together with you. ❤️

## Code of Conduct

See our [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file for our code of conduct.

## We Use GitHub Flow, Issues, Pull Requests, and Discussions

🗳️ We use [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) to manage changes. It is the most effective way to collaborate with all stakeholders on this project.

🐙 **Issues** are used to **track work**, such as bug reports and feature requests. They are also used to keep track of ideas that may not yet be ready to work on.

🚢 **Pull requests** are the best way to propose changes. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and/or create your branch from `main`.
2. Make sure your code lints.
3. Issue that pull request!

💬 **Discussions** is a space for our community of GitHub engineers, Partners, and Customers to have conversations, ask questions, post announcements, and share ideas. **We encourage you to participate in these discussions.**

## Ready to propose a change?

Create a branch or fork off of `main` and open a pull request for the maintainers to review. We'll work together to help navigate the proposed change! If you are submitting markdown, we use [GitHub Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/writing-for-github-docs/using-markdown-and-liquid-in-github-docs).

## Your pull request is merged

Congratulations! The whole GitHub community thanks you. ✨😄🚀

Once your pull request is merged, you will be proudly listed as a contributor in the contributor chart.
